                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>My name is Summer James, I'm 18 years old and am a student at Noorderpoort College based in Groningen, The Netherlands, where I currently study the course Software Developer Games.
                    Before I started studying game development, I lived in the UK for 7 years where I studied animal care. I decided that wasn't for me and followed my love for video games, which is how I ended up here! 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>During this course we have worked on both the art and programming side of game development. Although I do enjoy using Blender to create animations and models, My main focus lies in programming.
                    I love having my skills as a programmer be consistently challenged and pushed further, seeing growth and improvement everytime I work on a new project.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have also been a part of multiple team projects here which have been a lot of fun and have worked great in improving my communication skills.
